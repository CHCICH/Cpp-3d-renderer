# Cpp-3d-renderer

## Introduction

**WeakRayCasting** is a new or revisited method of raycasting. Unlike classical raycasting, where rays are rendered for each pixel, WeakRayCasting optimizes runtime by rendering rays for each vertex of the 3D objects. This method can be used in 3D rendering on webpages and can sometimes be faster than classical raycasting. The project is still in development, and contributions are welcome.

## How to Use the Library

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Cpp-3d-renderer.git
    cd Cpp-3d-renderer
    ```

2. **Build the Project**
    Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. Then, run:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

3. **Run the Renderer**
    ```sh
    ./renderer
    ```

4. **Integrate with Your Project**
    Include the necessary headers and link against the library in your project. Example:
    ```cpp
    #include "weakeraycasting.h"

    int main() {
         // Your code to initialize and use the renderer
    }
    ```

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, and contribute to the project!
